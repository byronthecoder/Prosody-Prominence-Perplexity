Table () summarise the correlations between prosodic features, word importance and word probability, any two of them as a pair. Significant correlation figures are coloured and the colour changes with the significance. 

\section{Prosodic Features - Word Importance Correlation}

In general, it could be concluded that the prominent prosodic features do correlate to the word importance, but the correlation is not very significant. The prominent prosodic features are extended duration, largely changed pitch and energy. According to table (), duration is positively correlated to word importance with a Spearman correlation coefficient valued 0.471, the greatest among others; excursion size correlation value, 0.251,  is comparatively great too, and the mean f0 follows with a value of 0.121. As for the raised voice, the correlation value for mean intensity is also commendable. The max f0 location feature is related to both duration and pitch, and the correlation, valued 0.231, is relatively strong too.

table(Prosodic Features - Word Importance Correlation)

Have we missed something? Yes, the first derivative of f0--max velocity and final velocity. They seem not very correlated. However, the derivative value can be positive or negative. It is the absolute value that matters. When using the absolute value to compute the correlation, it could be observed that the correlation value between max velocity and the word importance increased from 0.074 to a commendable level at 0.141 whereas the coefficient for final velocity didn't change prominently.

\section{Prosodic Features - Word Predictability Correlation}
Experiments proved that there is correlation between prominent prosodic features and word predictability as it is shown in table(), and the correlation is negative. With one prominent prosodic feature, for instance mean intensity, increasing, the word predictability tends to decrease, hence the word is less predictable. With a token size of 25,000, the most correlated feature is duration with its correlation coefficient valued -0.565. Excursion size and max f0 location rank second with a value around -0.28. The figure for mean intensity, -0.116, is noticeable, too. The p-value (section ) for each aforementioned prosodic features is much smaller than the significance level 0.05, indicating that the correlation is statistically highly significant.
