This experimental project aims to test a hypothesis that prosodic features in human speech such as intonation and rhythm correlate with the predictability of the utterance. Based on the literature survey and project analysis, the author has planned to select pitch accent, prosodic phrasing and tune as main features and use ToBI model to quantitatively analyze the spoken utterances in Switchboard corpus. A language model will be trained to compute the predictability of words using metrics of TF-IDF, perplexity and RIT annotation. The hypothesis is to be examined by comparing values, contours and perplexity.
