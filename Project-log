paper:
Automatic key term extraction from spoken course lectures using branching entropy and prosodic/semantic features

prosodic feature extraction tools:
- ProsodyPro * ---- A Praat script for large-scale systematic analysis of continuous prosodic events
- HTK forced alignment: segment the phonetic units 

It was argued that prosodic features in conference lectures are less useful because of the speaker variability.
