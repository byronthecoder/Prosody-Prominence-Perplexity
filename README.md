# Prosody-and-Perplexity
This experimental project is to investigate the correlation between the prosodic features of spoken utterances and the predictability of the word(s) been spoken.

###Background

One of the key functions of the ‘prosodic' patterning in speech is thought to be to draw attention to the key infomation-bearing elements of a spoken utterance.  In other words, the most important parts of an utterance are often associated with prosodic ‘prominence' such as increased loudness, large changes in the intonation, and extended segment durations.  From a linguistic perspective, the key information-bearing elements are those which are the least predictable.  Therefore, taking these two aspects together, it can be hypothesised that there should be a correlation between the predictability of words (known as ‘perplexity') and the major prosodic prominences in an utterance.

###Project Goal

The aim of this 'Experimental' project is to test this hypothesis.  Hence the project will involve the use of  (i) appropriate speech processing algorithms to derive prosodic features from a selected corpus of recorded utterances, (ii) appropriate text processing algorithms to compute the predictability of each individual word in the corresponding transcripts, and (iii) statistical tools to analyse the putative relationship between the two.  The prosodic features might be calculated using a toolkit such as ‘openSMILE’, and the perplexity might be calculated using the ‘CMU-SLM’ toolkit.
